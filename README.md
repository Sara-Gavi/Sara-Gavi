# ✨ Welcome to my humble tech world! ✨

Hi! I'm Sara **Junior Full Stack Developer** and I love enjoying life. Weaving the digital world and technology to develop my creativity and enjoy the freedom of movement, nature and sports for self-care, and a social vision to guide my actions.

## Why Web Development?

- 🌟 Curiosity and creativity are key in exploring new technologies.
- 🧠 Enjoying solving challenges, where coding feels like solving a mystery.
- 🌍 Technology helps society grow and improve by making things more efficient.
- 🌳 Caring about the environment and making technologies that help protect it.
- 🤝 I want to grow as a professional in technology and as a person in dynamic and committed environments.
